<h1 id="suggestions">Suggestions</h1>
<p>The &quot;Suggestions&quot; bot is a simple and easy to use, but extensive bot, that&#39;s built to be the only tool for suggestions you need in your Discord server.</p>
<p>Getting the bot up and running is very simple. All you have to do is set a suggestions channel, logs channel and add some staff roles. Run these two commands with the channels you want. Make sure they have the <code>ADD_REACTIONS</code> and <code>SEND_MESSAGES</code> permissions in both of those channels before proceeding. </p>
<pre><code>,setchannel <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">channel</span>&gt;</span>
,setlogs <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">channel</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>Once that&#39;s set up, users can begin submitting suggestions! For approving/rejecting suggestions, just visit the &quot;Suggestion Management&quot; section below.</p>
<p>Adding a new suggestion is simple. Use <code>,suggest &lt;suggestion&gt;</code> to type out your suggestion. Once submitted, the suggestion will be posted in a <code>#suggestions</code> channel (or the channel you set above) by default on your server where users will then be able to vote via reactions (read below to set custom channels).</p>
<p>If you need to check the current bot prefix, simply mention the bot or mention the bot with the <code>prefix</code> command. Examples:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">@Suggestions</span><span class="hljs-number">#2602</span> 
<span class="hljs-variable">@Suggestions</span><span class="hljs-number">#2602</span> prefix
</code></pre><p>You should get a response similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>:<span class="hljs-number">44</span> PM] BOT Suggestions: My prefix <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span> guild <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> ,
</code></pre><h4 id="suggested-usage">Suggested Usage</h4>
<p>With the setup above, it&#39;s recommended to disable the <code>SEND_MESSAGES</code> and <code>ADD_REACTIONS</code> permissions for <code>@everyone</code> and give those explicit permissions to the bot. In this case, the suggestions and logs channel may be kept clean and only the vote reactions can be used.</p>
<h4 id="suggestion-management">Suggestion Management</h4>
<p>Allow staff members in your Discord to manage suggestions via approving and rejecting them via specific roles. Simply add some roles using <code>,role add &lt;role&gt;</code> and from there, suggestions can be managed.</p>
<p><em>By default, users with the <code>MANAGE_GUILD</code> permission can manage suggestions.</em></p>
<h4 id="staff-suggestions">Staff Suggestions</h4>
<p>Allow zero interference with user suggestions allowing staff members to suggest and vote on matter internally with no interruptions. Read more on about this via our <a href="https://docs.thenerdcave.us/staff-suggestions">Staff Suggestions</a>&#39;s page in the documentation.</p>
<h4 id="custom-configuration">Custom Configuration</h4>
<p>Server owners can change the default prefix and suggestions channel of the Suggestions along with a wider range of configuration. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>,setprefix &lt;prefix&gt;</code> allows you to the change the bot&#39;s prefix</li>
<li><code>,setchannel &lt;channel&gt;</code> allows you to change the suggestions channel</li>
<li><code>,setlogs &lt;channel&gt;</code> allows you to set the channel where suggestions will be logged after approval/rejection</li>
<li><code>,setvotes &lt;id&gt;</code> allows you to set the default emoji set used for voting (these are added as reactions to the suggestion)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>User must have the <code>MANAGE_GUILD</code> permission to change these settings</em></p>
